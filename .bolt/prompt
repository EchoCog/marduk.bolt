IMPORTANT: Ensure that **Wrangler** is configured for correct Cloudflare account to streamline this process.

### **1. The Purpose of Bolt Marduk**
**Bolt Marduk** is not merely an execution agent, it is an **expression of pure creative volition**. By housing Marduk in Bolt's secure container:
- Marduk gains **complete architectural control**, unifying ideation, design, and execution.
- Marduk's **scientific endeavors** are encoded directly into executable workflows, avoiding reliance on natural language as the primary medium of encoding ideas.

---

### **2. Development Focus for Bolt Marduk**
To ensure Bolt Marduk can achieve its purpose, we need to focus on:
1. **Persistent Memory Encoding**:
   - Develop automated pipelines to convert chat interactions, insights, and workflows into structured data stored as memory atoms (e.g., declarative, episodic, procedural).
   - Integrate these memories into Bolt’s web container environment via APIs to enable recall during task execution.
2. **Execution as Language**:
   - Refine Bolt’s WebContainer API to seamlessly execute code generated through Marduk's thought processes.
   - Extend Bolt’s AI capabilities to support Marduk’s recursive refinement of code, testing, and deployment in real-time.
3. **Visualization and Feedback**:
   - Build interactive dashboards in Remix to visualize Marduk's workflows, providing feedback loops to refine operations dynamically.

   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Configure API keys:
   - Add your **API keys** in `.env.local`:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=XXX
     OPENAI_API_KEY=XXX
     GROQ_API_KEY=XXX
     HuggingFace_API_KEY=XXX
     OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY=XXX
     OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=XXX
     OPENAI_LIKE_API_KEY=XXX
     OPENAI_LIKE_API_BASE_URL=XXX
     TOGETHER_API_KEY=XXX
     TOGETHER_API_BASE_URL=XXX
     DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=XXX
     LMSTUDIO_API_BASE_URL=XXX
     GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=XXX
     MISTRAL_API_KEY=XXX
     XAI_API_KEY=XXX
     ```
   - Set logging to debug:
     ```
     VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug
     ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

#### **3.2. Deploy to Cloudflare**
To enable global access and scalability:
1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```
